# Democracy works best when every voice is heard
At Microsoft, we believe that elections should be open and secure. We're doing our part by safeguarding democratic processes, promoting a healthy information ecosystem, and advocating for corporate civic responsibility.

As part of our commitments, we're open-sourcing our entire 2024 Voter Registration campaign design, a comprehensive toolkit of graphic resources designed to help you engage your communities, workplaces, and friends. These open-source materials are crafted to help you create communications that emphasize the importance of voting and encourage others to register and vote. Use them to amplify your voice, and encourage others to use theirs.

Get the assets here, [register to vote](https://microsoft.turbovote.org/) and learn more about how we're [advancing and protecting democracy at Microsoft](https://aka.ms/Vote2024).

# Be part of something bigger
These vibrant and dynamic designs are inspired by the diverse voices and perspectives that drive our democracy. Through an array of fonts, colors, textures, and shapes, these graphics emphasize the collective power of individual votes, deliberately avoiding voting clich√©s to foster inclusivity and engagement. Celebrating the richness of our electoral process, this expression underscores that democracy thrives when every voice is heard.
